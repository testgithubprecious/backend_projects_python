# Low-Level Backend Projects (Built from Scratch)

Welcome to the **Low-Level Backend Projects Series** â€” a collection of backend systems built from the ground up using only **pure Python** and **core data structures** like queues, heaps, hash maps, tries, linked lists, and more.

This project is perfect for beginners that thinks the internet and website operate with magic, who wants to go *below the framework* and understand how tools like **Flask**, **Express**, and **Django** work under the hood. Here, youâ€™ll discover not just **how** backend systems are built â€” but **why** they are designed the way they are.

## Why This Exists

Frameworks are powerful. But they often hide the fundamentals.

These projects will help you:

- Build a **deep understanding** of backend systems.
- Appreciate the **abstractions** provided by frameworks.
- Learn when and why **specific data structures or algorithms** are used.

 A beginner-friendly **guide** on the link below will explain:
- The problem being solved
- The reasoning behind each implementation
- The data structures used and why they were the best fit

##  Projects Included

Each project is built from scratch in Python. No external frameworks.

How to Run the Projects

ðŸ”¹ 1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/testgithubprecious/backend_projects_python.git
cd backend_projects_python/project-folder-name #replace project-folder-name with any of the project folder name given.

ðŸ”¹ 2. For Basic Server Projects

If a file like server.py is provided, run it using:

python3 server.py

After running the code, check the terminal output for something like:

http://localhost:8000/

Copy and paste that into your browser to view the serverâ€™s response.


ðŸ”¹ 3. For the rest Projects (Usually the Last 8)

For the other projects, the main.py file is your entry point.

cd backend_projects_python/project-folder-name
python3 main.py

All other modules are already imported in main.py, so running it should show the output directly.
